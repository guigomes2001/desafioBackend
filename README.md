# Backend Challenge - Java ![Java Logo](https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/java/java-icon.svg)
with Spring Boot

This challenge was based on the proposal from the Loans Challenge repository.

The challenge consists of creating a logic in Java using Spring Boot that receives an HTTP POST request (tested using Postman), interprets the data passed in the 'Body', and returns the types of loans available for the provided data.
